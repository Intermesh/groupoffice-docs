Backup Group-Office
===================

You need to backup the following items:

1. The configuration file config.php. Can be found in /etc/groupoffice or in 
   the source directory.

2. The MySQL / MariaDB database. You can find the connection parameters in config.php

3. The data folder. You can find the "file_storage_path" in the config.php file.

4. If you use the Group-Office mailserver, then also backup the e-mail that's 
   located in /var/mail/vhosts.
