Backup Group-Office
===================

You need to backup the following items:

1. The configuration file config.ini
   Can be found in /etc/groupoffice or in any folder of the source directory path.

2. The MySQL / MariaDB database. You can look the "dsn" up in config.ini file.

3. The data folder. You can look the "dataPath" up in the config.ini file.

4. If you use the Group-Office mailserver, then also backup the e-mail that's 
   located in /var/mail/vhosts.
