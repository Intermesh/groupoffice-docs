Upgrade
=======

You can upgrade any version from Group-Office. For some versions it's necessary
to do it in steps:

- 2.18 can upgrade to 3.7.55
- 3.7.55 can upgrade to 6.2
- 6.2 can upgrade to 6.3
- 6.3 can upgrade to 6.4 and so on. Every major release needs to be upgraded to the next from 6.2 and higher.

Make sure your system meets the :ref:`system-requirements`.

Needless to say, but always make a **backup** before upgrading.
