Upgrade
=======

You can upgrade any version from Group-Office. For some versions it's necessary
to do it in steps:

- 2.18 can upgrade to 3.7.55
- 3.7.55 can upgrade to 6.2
- 6.2 can upgrade to 6.3
- Every major release needs to be upgraded to the next from 6.2 and higher.

Needless to say, but always make a **backup** before upgrading.

After the upgrade you should consider replacing the "gota" module with the new
"assistant" module for better file editing on the desktop.

You can find the change log here:

You might need to switch to the branch (For example 6.3) to view the latest.
