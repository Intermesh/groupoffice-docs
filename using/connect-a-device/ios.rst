iOS (iPhone or iPad)
====================

On iOS you can connect using ActiveSync.
You can synchronize:

- Notes
- Calendar
- Contacts
- E-mail
- Tasks (Called "Reminders" on iOS)

To setup an ActiveSync account take the following steps:

1. Navigate to Settings and lookup the "Accounts & Passwords" page.

2. Click on "Add account".

7. iOS now attempts to discover settings on the domain of your e-mail address. 
   In this example "intermesh.nl". It is likely to fail because this is not the 
   correct ActiveSync server address. It give a certficate error. Just ignore it 
   by clicking "Continue".
