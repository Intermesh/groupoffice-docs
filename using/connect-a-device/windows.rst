Outlook / Windows 10
--------------------

Note: This guide describes Outlook but this kind of ActiveSync account also 
works for the Windows 10 Mail, People and Calendar app.

To setup an ActiveSync account take the following steps:

1. Open Outlook and click "File". 
2. Then click "Add account".

5. In the next screen you must adjust your server settings. It will prefill the 
   username with the e-mail address and the server name with the domain from 
   your e-mail address. This is most likely **incorrect**.
   Please adjust to your Group-Office username and enter the :ref:`server-hostname`.
   When done click "Next".

   screen.
