Links
=====

Group-Office has a very powerful link function. Each item can be linked to 
another. The link function gives you the ability to organize your data easily.
You can for example link:

- E-mail messages
- Tasks
- Projects
- Contacts
- Organizations
- Calendar events
- Notes
- Files
- Invoices
- Quotes

Create a link
-------------

Every item that supports links has an "Add" menu button with a + icon.

If you want to search for an existing item in the system choose "Existing item".
All other items will open the create dialog to link a new item.

Viewing links
-------------

Links are grouped by type in detail views. Here's an example of a how links are 
shown in the detail view of a contact:

If you'd like to browse, search and filter links without jumping in the system
you can use the link browser.
