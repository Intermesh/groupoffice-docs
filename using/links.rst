Links
=====

GroupOffice has a very powerful link function. Each item can be linked to
another. The link function gives you the ability to organize your data easily.
You can for example link:

- E-mail messages
- Tasks
- Projects
- Contacts
- Organizations
- Calendar events
- Notes
- Files
- Invoices
- Quotes

Create a link
-------------

Every item that supports links has an "Add" menu button with a + icon.

If you want to search for an existing item in the system choose "Existing item".
All other items will open the create dialog to link a new item.

Viewing links
-------------

Links are grouped by type in detail views. Here's an example of a how links are 
shown in the detail view of a contact:

If you'd like to browse, search and filter links without jumping in the system
you can use the link browser.

Managing links
--------------

Since a link is defined as a custom connection between two entities, a link will be automatically deleted when one of the
linked entities is deleted.

Next to each link, you can call a small menu to do perform certain actions

Optionally, one can edit a link by writing a description for it. This may enable the user to give a bit more
information of the nature of said link.

Of course, a link can be removed manually by selecting the Delete option in the menu.
