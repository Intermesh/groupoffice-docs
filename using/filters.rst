Custom Filters
==============

Some modules support custom filters. You can create a reusable filter in which you create
your own conditions. They also work great together with :ref:`custom-fields`.

For example you've defined a custom field "Education" and you want to show all 
"Software engineers" you can easily do this with a custom filter.

Here's a screenshot of the address book:

In the picture above you can see two custom filters called "Software engineers" and "Users".

Adding a filter
---------------

Click the add button in the filters toolbar to open the filter dialog.
Add your conditions and click "Save".
If you want to share this filter with other users you can add groups in the permissions tab.
