Share folders
-------------
It's easy to share folders in Group-Office. Any user can do it. If you want to create a shared folder for the whole
organization it's recommended to do this as the "admin" user. Take the following steps:

1. Right click on the folder that you want to share and click 'Properties'

2. Check 'Activate sharing'

3. Add the right user groups in the 'Permissions' tab.

The folder will show up under shared for other users. Not for the user that shared it.
