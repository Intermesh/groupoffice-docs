Files
=====

In the "Files" tab you can manage your personal files and share folders with other users. The files module is
integrated in most other modules as well. So you can add files to Contacts, Projects, Tasks, Appointments etc.

Share folders
-------------
It's easy to share folders in Group-Office. Any user can do it. If you want to create a shared folder for the whole
organization it's recommended to do this as the "admin" user. Take the following steps:

1. Right click on the folder that you want to share and click 'Properties'

   .. figure:: /_static/using/files/share-folder-1.png
      :alt: Share folder 1
      :width: 50%

2. Check 'Activate sharing'

   .. figure:: /_static/using/files/share-folder-2.png

      :width: 50%

3. Add the right user groups in the 'Permissions' tab.

   .. figure:: /_static/using/files/share-folder-3.png
      :alt: Share folder 3
      :width: 50%

The folder will show up under shared for other users. Not for the user that shared it.

.. note:: Visibility of files is solely dependent on the permissions defined for its containing folder. There is no way to hide individual files except to move them in a private folder.

Opening files
-------------
Opening files is as easy as a double click on the file of course. But you can also change the default
action. For example you might want to edit text documents with :ref:`Only Office <onlyoffice>`,
:ref:`Microsoft Office Online <officeonline>` or your :ref:`own desktop application <assistant>`.
You can view images in the online viewer or in a browser tab. To change this
right click on a file and choose "Open with...". Check the box "Remember my decision for this file type"
to make it the default. Then choose your preferred action.

Sharing individual files
------------------------

Depending on the file type and access to email, a user can share their files in the following ways:


1. **Copy direct link**: ill copy a direct link to the file to the clipboard. In order to use a direct link as copied to
the clipboard, one should be logged into Group-Office and have access to the file's parent folder. Otherwise, they will
be redicerted to the front page.

2. **Create download link**: will generate a token and create a link for that. You can copy/paste that link from the
file panel. The recipient of that link does not need to be logged in, as they access the file through the generated
token. You can optionally expire the token on a certain date.

3. **Email download link**: Does the same as (2), but sends the link directly by email.

4. **Email files**: will attach the selected file(s) to a new email message as with any other email client.


Moving to trash versus deleting
-------------------------------

As of versions 6.8.113 and 25.0.12, you can either delete a file entirely or move it to a trash folder. By moving files and folders into trash,
the user can restore it to its original location if need be. The DEL key is mapped to moving a file to trash, whereas Ctrl+DEL
will fully delete a file or folder.

When an item is moved to trash, its original permissions are kept. In other words, a user can only see a trashed item if they have permissions
to its original parent folder.
