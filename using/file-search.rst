File search
===========

With the file search module you can deep search the contents of files. This 
module in combination with custom fields and the quick edit pane makes the
perfect E-Discovery solution. 

Group-Office can index the following file types:

- Microsoft Office Documents
- Open Document format (Open Office, LibreOffice)
- Saved E-mails including attachments. It does not search an IMAP server.
- PDF
- Plain text
- Scanned images using OCR

Next to the regular search it's also possible to create complex queries with 
the advanced search.
