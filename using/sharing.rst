Sharing
=======

All items in Group-Office are protected with permissions. For example 
address books, task lists, calendars, Note categories, Billing books and 
project types have access control. When you setup permissions you can add 
user groups and users to the access control list. There are different levels of 
permission:

+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Level             | Description                                             |
+===================+=========================================================+
| Read only         | All items are read only                                 |
+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Create            | Users may create new items but can't change them        |
|                   | afterwards.                                             |
+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Write             | Full write access                                       |
+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Delete            | Delete is allowed                                       |
+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Manage            | The user can do everything and can also change the      |
|                   | permissions.                                            |
+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+

Sharing works similar for most items. You can access the share dialog via the 
menu in the address book for example:


.. figure:: /_static/using/sharing/share-menu.png
   :width: 50%
   
   Share via menu


.. figure:: /_static/using/sharing/share-dialog.png
   :width: 100%
   
   Share dialog


.. note:: **Global address book**

   If you want to create a global shared address book it is recommended to add 
   this address book as the "admin" user so it won't be deleted along with a 
   regular user when this employee leaves the company for example.


Default permissions
-------------------

By default items are only shared with the administrator and owner. You can change that at the :ref:`default-permissions`.
You can also add a group or user to all existing items.
