Workflow
========

With this module you can add steps that need approval to almost every item inside Group-Office.

Simple example usage (homework)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- A student needs to create homework and that needs to be checked by the teacher:
- The teacher can set a workflow process for a folder in the files module.
- If the student uploads a file to the folder, the authorized teacher need to approve the file.
- If the teacher finds that the document is OK, then he can approve the file and add a comment to it or if the document is NOT OK, then the teacher can add a comment to it and decline the document.
- The student can see if the document is approved or declined and he can see the reason of it.
- If it was declined, then the student can upload a new file to the folder and then the checking of the teacher begins again.

Simple example usage (billing)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- A employee can make invoices for the customers of the company where he is working.
- The administrator sets up a workflow process for the invoices which required approval before sending it to the customer.
- After the employee has created and saved an invoice, the manager gets a reminder that he must check the invoice.
- The manager can approve or decline the invoice and add a comment to it for the sake of the employee.
- If the invoice was declined(wrong) then the employee can edit it and save it again.

If you have permission to administer a step then you can approve or decline items that have that step. Each item
that has a step that you can administer is displayed in the workflow grid. If you double click on an item in the
grid (or just double click on the item itself) a popup will come up in wich you can approve or decline the step.


After you have clicked on "Approve" or "Decline" a small window will appear on the screen in where you need to add
some comments. This comment is needed to clarify your approval or decline back to the user(owner) of the file.
