Search
======

GroupOffice has a powerful search function that will search through all items.

You can find it at the top bar:

.. figure:: /_static/using/global-search.png
   :alt: Search
   :width: 100%

   Search via top bar


Query syntax
------------

When you enter words it will find results that match all of those words.

For example when searching for::

   John Doe

It will find anything with John* AND Doe*. Because of the automatic wildcards (*) also "Jonathan" will match for example.

If you want to search for a phrase or without wildcards then you can use quotes::

   "John Doe"
