Getting started
===============

So you've installed GroupOffice or signed up for a the cloud service. That's great! But what now? These steps should
help you get started:

1. **Switch**: Are you coming from another system like Microsoft Office 365 or Google Workspace? Then check out our migration guides for :ref:`switching <switch>`.
2. **E-mail server**: Do you want to setup e-mail? Then you need an IMAP service. If you don't have one yet you can host your own or get it
   from our GroupOffice hosting service. If you signed up for that you will get instructions to setup the DNS.
   When using the :ref:`GroupOffice mailserver <mailserver>`, also setup the :ref:`Serverclient module <serverclient>` so you will auto create mailboxes for each GroupOffice user.

3. **Modules**: Install the modules you need at **System Settings** -> :ref:`Modules <modules>`. Remove the once you don't need to make the menu clean.
4. **User groups**: Setup :ref:`user groups <user-groups>`. User groups make it easy for setting up users later. Not everybody needs access to the finance module for example. Make a "Finance" group to administrate that easily.
5. **Users**: :ref:`Add or import users <users>`. Also consider if you want to use an :ref:`SSO solution with OpenID connect<oauth2>`, :ref:`IMAP authentication <map-authentication>` or :ref:`LDAP authentication <ldap>`.
6. **E-mail accounts**: If e-mail accounts are not created automatically, then you can :ref:`create IMAP accounts <create-imap-accounts>` for the users.
7. **Contacts**: Learn how to :ref:`create a shared address book <sharing-addressbook>`.
8. **Files**: Learn how to :ref:`create a shared folder or drive <share-folders>`.
9. **Mobile Sync**: Learn about how to :ref:`connect your mobile phone or desktop apps <connect-a-device>`

By taking these steps you've learned a lot about the system. There's a lot more on this site to explore. And if you
need any help then `don't hesitate to contact Intermesh <https://www.group-office.com/contact>`_ or ask on `Github Discussions <https://github.com/Intermesh/groupoffice/discussions>`_.
