Getting started
===============

So you've installed Group-Office or signed up for a the cloud service. That's great! But what now? These steps should
help you get started:

1. Are you coming from another system like Microsoft Office 365 or Google Workspace? Then check out our guides for :ref:`switching <switch>`.
2. Do you want to setup mail? Then you need an IMAP service. If you don't have one yet you can host your own or get it
   from our Group-Office hosting service. If you signed up for that you will get instructions to setup the DNS.
   When using the Group-Office mailserver, also setup the serverclient so you will auto create mailboxes for each Group-Office user.
3. Install the modules you need at **System Settings** -> :ref:`Modules <modules>`. Remove the once you don't need to make the menu clean.
4. Setup :ref:`user groups <user-groups>`. User groups make it easy for setting up users later. Not everybody needs access to the finance module for example. Make a "Finance" group to administrate that easily.
5. :ref:`Add or import users <users>`. Also consider if you want to use an :ref:`SSO solution with OpenID connect<oauth2>`, :ref:`IMAP authentication <map-authentication>` or :ref:`LDAP authentication <ldap>`.
6. If e-mail accounts are not created automatically, then you can :ref:`create IMAP accounts <create-imap-accounts>` for the users.
7. Learn how to :ref:`create a shared address book <sharing-addressbook>`.
8. Learn how to :ref:`create a shared folder or drive <share-folders>`.
9. Learn about how to :ref:`connect your mobile phone or desktop apps <connect-a-device>`

By taking these steps you've learned a lot about the system. There's a lot more on this site to explore. And if you
need any help then `don't hesitate to contact Intermesh <https://www.group-office.com/contact>`_ or ask on `Github Discussions <https://github.com/Intermesh/groupoffice/discussions>`_.
