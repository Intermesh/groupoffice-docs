Custom fields
=============

Every organization is different and has different data to store. That's why most 
entities in Group-Office can be extended with custom fields.

Custom fields show in the:

- Edit dialogs
- Detail views
- Grid columns
- Advanced search and filters

You can create custom fields via System settings at:

- Notes
- Address book
- Billing
- Tickets
- Calendar
- Tasks
- Files

.. note:: The above list depends on the modules installed. You may have less or
   more options

Creating fields
---------------

Navigate to System settings -> Address book for example.

Click the + icon to add a field set first. A field set is a group of fields that 
has a title and an optional description that will be shown on the form.
You can also hide field set in some cases. This depends on the module. In the 
address book you can only show it on certain address books for example.

When you've created a field set you can add a field via the '+' button on the 
field set row:
