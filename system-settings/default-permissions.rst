Update existing items
---------------------

When you've changed the defaults and you've already created a lot of calendars for example. You might want to add
a group to all calendars. You can do this with the "Add to all" or "Reset all" buttons.

Double click "Calendar" to open the edit default permission screen:

Then click **Add to all** to keep existing permissions but add the missing groups from the defaults. Or click **Reset all**
to remove existing permissions and reset it to the defaults.
