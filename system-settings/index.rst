System settings
===============

System settings are only available to administrators. When you click on the 
avatar icon on the top right you can open the "System settings" page. This is 
the place to configure everything for Group-Office. 

.. note:: When setting up Group-Office we recommend to review each tab and make 
   adjustments where necessary before you start creating users and start 
   using the system.
