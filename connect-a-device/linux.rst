Files
-----

With the Group Office assistant you can edit files directly in Group Office. When 
you launch a file by double clicking it will automatically mount the webdav drive
and launch the default application on your computer.

On Debian based distributions you can install the Group Office Assistant.

1. First add our repository to /etc/apt/sources.list::

      deb http://repo.group-office.com/ one main

2. Add our public key::

      gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 0758838B
      gpg --export --armor 0758838B | sudo apt-key add -

3. Update APT::

     sudo apt-get update

4. Then install Group Office Assistant by running::

     sudo apt-get install groupoffice-assistant

5. Now double click a file in Group Office and it can be edited on your desktop 
   instantly.

Note: due to a bug in Ubuntu you'll get this ignorable error::
  
  Error in file "/usr/share/applications/org.gnome.font-viewer.desktop": "font/ttf" is an invalid MIME type ("font" is an unregistered media type)
